Simple project to look at [Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org/), a library for analysing time-series data on the brightness of stars.

Datasets available at:

https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html

Searching the catalogue:

set the distance to between 12 and 24 parsecs
and temperature, T_eff to something low as we are looking at red dwarfs that will have rapidly orbiting planets, which suits are data.

With tge results of that search we can use the star Id to look in [exomast](https://exo.mast.stsci.edu/) to see if exoplanets have already been found.
